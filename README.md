  + A. Data Cleaning:
    - I. Data Checking:
      + I.1. Check Column Type --> Column "Date" is in Object dtype
      + I.2. Check %Blank/Null --> Column "Promotion": 33.4% (but these are "None")
      + I.3. Check duplicate:
        - For whole row
        - For ID: Column "Transaction_ID"
      + I.4. Check Outliers: by IQR & export for preventing numbers of outliers is too high
        - Column "Total_Cost"
        - Column "Total_Items"
    - II. Data Handling
      + II.1. Change type to datetime: Column "Date"
        - Using pd.to_datetime
      + II.2. Handle 33.4% blank of Column "Promotion"
        - Add "keep_default_na= False" when read csv for preventing Python recording "None" value is N/A
