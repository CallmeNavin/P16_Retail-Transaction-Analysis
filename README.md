# P16_Retail-Transaction-Analysis

**VERSION 1 - Market Basket Analysis**

**A. Project Overview**

- This project aims to explore associations between products and uncover buying patterns (MBA - Market Basket Analysis).

**B. Dataset Information**

_**Source**_

- Retail Transactions Dataset (from Kaggle).
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/retail-transactions-dataset.
- The dataset includes 01 files - Retail_Transactions_Dataset.
- The Data uploaded have only 100 rows for each file. Please visit the below Kaggle link for full data.

_**Period**_

- From 2020 - 2024

**C. Methodology**

- Data Cleaning: handle missing values (Promotion ~33%), remove duplicates, detect outliers (IQR), and convert date types.
- Data Handling: export cleaned dataset for analysis.
- Market Basket Analysis (MBA): 
  + Reshape data to Transaction–Item format.
  + One-hot encoding for products.
  + Apply FPGrowth and generate Association Rules.
  + Filter rules by Support, Confidence, and Lift.

**D. Key Findings & Actionable Plans**

_**Key Findings**_

- After filtering by Lift > 1, several potential associations emerge:
  + Peanut Butter → Toothpaste (Support ~0.26%, Confidence ~7.3%, Lift ~1.03).
  + Canned Soup → Toothpaste (Support ~0.26%, Confidence ~7.2%, Lift ~1.02).
  + Ironing Board → Toothpaste (Support ~0.25%, Confidence ~7.1%, Lift ~1.01).
→ Although support is relatively low (<0.3%), these rules suggest non-random relationships between FMCG items and a personal care product (Toothpaste).

_**Actionable Plans**_

- Cross-sell bundles: propose small promotions or product bundles combining Toothpaste with Peanut Butter or Canned Soup.
- Placement strategy: experiment with positioning Toothpaste closer to FMCG shelves (e.g., food and daily essentials).
- Test & Learn: since support remains limited, conduct A/B testing in a controlled setting before scaling up.
